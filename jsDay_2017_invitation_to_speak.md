Hi Patricia,

 I’m cirpo, a member of the [jsDay](http://jsday.it) steering committee.
 I couldn't find your email, that's why I'm trying to contact you via a PR (and Linkedin), sorry for being insistent, I hope you don't mind :P
 I’m contacting you because I was really amazed after watching your great talk **"Good Tech for Hard Places: Fighting Ebola with JS"** on youtube 
 and we would like to have you on stage at jsDay 2017, which will be in **Verona, Italy on May 10th-11th 2017**.


 This will be the 8th edition of the international JavaScript conference, organized by GrUSP.


 GrUSP is a non-profit organisation which works to create a healthier tech ecosystem in Italy since 2003.
 We organise conferences (Kerning, BetterSoftware, phpDay) and we help local user groups in their activities.
 The jsDay is growing at a rapid pace: the last 4 editions went sold out, gathering together nearly 400 passionate JavaScript developers at each event.
 We strongly believe in collaboration and sharing between people and our goal is not just to spread the knowledge of JavaScript, but also help developers to grow as healthy, strong and open-minded professionals.


* *Would you join us? :)**
